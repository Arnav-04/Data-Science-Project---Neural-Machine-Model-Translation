# Neural Machine Translation (NMT) Model for Spanish-to-English Translation

Welcome to the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model-building project! This project is part of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) course, focusing on attention-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models. In this project, you’ll build an NMT model that translates text from Spanish to English, using attention mechanisms to capture context and deliver accurate translations.

### Project Background
Due to language barriers, a U.S.-based life insurance company faces challenges communicating with the Spanish-speaking community in Mexico. The company requires a robust machine translation solution to translate application request letters from Spanish to English, enabling seamless communication and service provision to the local community. This project highlights the real-world applicability of NMT models in bridging language gaps and facilitating better business interactions.

### Problem Statement
Your task is to develop an attention-based Seq2Seq model capable of translating Spanish sentences into coherent English. This involves preprocessing Spanish text data, handling special characters, and implementing an attention mechanism to improve translation quality. The model’s objective is to ensure effective and contextually accurate translation, catering to the specific linguistic characteristics of the Spanish language.

### Why This Project Matters
This project will deepen your understanding of attention mechanisms within NMT models. You will learn how to handle data preprocessing challenges specific to Spanish, particularly with special characters, and gain practical experience designing, training, and testing a neural translation model. While this assignment focuses on Spanish-to-English translation, the skills acquired here are adaptable to other languages and business contexts.
